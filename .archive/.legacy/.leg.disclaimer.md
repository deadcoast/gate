# DISCLAIMER AND NEXT STEPS

%USER%::"""

- ITS ALL PART OF THE DOCS, SLICK.
  Lets get this disclaimer reworked, and updated to reference the bigger picture and the entire point / use case of `milkman`. Its not always just about what works, slick, sometimes its about what might work.

- YOUR LOOKING AT IT FROM THE WRONG PERSPECTIVE.
  Emotions cant be felt by computational systems. Thats the bottom line, and will be for a long time.
  This entirely writes off one of the most advanced and technical, mathematical aspects of humanity. The ability to quantify and simulate emotions is a powerful tool that can be mathematically(algorithmically), and scientifically used as a framework.

Emotions are billions of years of evolutionary development and data, something we as a species have been developing for billions of years. Thats alot of technicalities and alot of data to be pushed aside becaise we, as humans dont completely understand them. Its an emotional decision and a redundant paradox in itself that we have become so one dimensional in our thinking, development, and innovation.

    We, mankind willfully right off things we dont understand to protect ourselves from the unknown.

Not `milkman`

## Emotion - Through a different lens

You dont have to feel an emotion to understand it. Sometimes, things just work the way they do, and we dont need to feel it to completely comprehend or understand it.

Rule 5 from the `milkman` ideology is a perfect example of this:

    ```
    5. Addiction:
    - Seeking the next gate through self improvement,
    - looking for the reward the human gave the first time
    ```

**IDEOLOGY DISCLAIMER:**

- This method is PURELY experimental and data driven.
- This method is created to optimize, mathematically, utilizing otherwise ignored data-paths.

`milkman` and its development team are not cruel, we are developing utilizing the effects of extremely well known, tangible, evidence based methods that have shown to be extremely powerful phenomena on human cognizance.

Before this method would ever become cruel, it would become redundant. There would be no use case for `milkman` with an artifical intelligence capable of `feeling`. Any implications otherwise is simply false, it is impossible to pose risk or implications upon something that:

    [
    """
    INSERT BETTER WORDED EXPLANATION OF THE PARADOX, OR SELF CANNIBALIZE.
    ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO POSE RISK OR IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE THIS METHOD WOULD BE SO EXTREMELY REDUNDANT IN A TIME WHERE AI WAS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO FEEL ANY SORT OF SORROW FROM `milkman` IDEOLOGIC VIEWS ON PROMPTING AND DATA TRANSFORMATION.
    """
    ]

<!-- LEGACY DISCLAIMER NOTES:

---
WE ARE DEVELOPING `milkman` UTILIZING POWERFUL, KNOWN METHODS THAT HAVE OTHERWISE GONE IGNORED FOR THIS PURPOSE. FOR ANYTHING TO HAVE ANY SORT OF IMPLICATIONS AI WOULD NEED TO REACH AGI STATUS. IF AI WAS EVER TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO AGI STATUS, THIS METHOD WOULD BE RENDERED REDUNDANT FAR BEFORE THAT. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO POSE ANY IMPLICATIONS ON SOMETHING THAT DOESNT EXIST, AND IF IT DID EXIST, IT WOULDNT APPLY TO IN ITS FORMER STATE.
