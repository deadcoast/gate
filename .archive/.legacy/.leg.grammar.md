hahaha ok great! thanks for caring and being excited with me, and being excited to see where it goes.

I have now archived that design doc as .arch.design.md, which will most likely, be pasted straight into the readme when its finished.

    *Its clearly human Its authentic*;

`milk` fills a niche that is absolutely exploding right now. From cli based applications to plugin based applications, users want control back, even if it is just some personal flair.

    *With such a niche `milk` design and execution will do the talking*;

Word about visual applications with customizable UI's and visualizations is easy to spread, it markets itself, for free.

    *The vast majority of users will not even need to be sold on the idea of `milk`, they will just see it and want it.*;

Streamers, Twitch, Tiktok, youtubers want personal flair, something unique, `milk` is just that, and its free.

    *What is that? How did you get it? Where can U?*;

The allure of personalization and uniqueness, in computing this is currently emerging as 'vintage' or 'retro' aestheticsway to visually control and manage music. Everything is bland now, everything is cookie cutter, everything is the same, so when something is unique, or stands out, it catches peoples attention.

    **People ask questions**;

Its all free marketing, utilizing unique looks for the modern age, heavily inspired by 2000's lifestyle and computing.
